### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | = 0.6KHz| = |0.45KHz
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | = 300KHz| = |400KHz
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = \) 299.4KHz| \( BW = f'h - f'l = \) 399.55KHz|
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = \)12.88 | \( A'{v(mid)} = \) 8.40|
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 9.40 | 5.93 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
